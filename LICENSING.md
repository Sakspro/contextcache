## Why Dual License?

We believe research and education should be freely accessible (Apache 2.0), while sustainable development for commercial use requires support (PolyForm NC + Commercial).

This approach:
- Keeps academic/personal use fully open
- Allows evaluation before commitment
- Funds ongoing development and security
- Ensures long-term project health
